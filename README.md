## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript outside of a browser, primarily used for server-side applications. It's known for its non-blocking, asynchronous nature, which makes it efficient for handling tasks like file operations, database interactions, and HTTP requests.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Install PNPM**: Run `npm install -g pnpm` to globally install PNPM, which offers improved performance and efficient disk space management.

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Development

- **Synchronous**: Tasks are executed one after another. Each task waits for the previous one to complete.
- **Asynchronous**: Tasks operate independently. Node.js thrives in this model, allowing non-blocking operations, enhancing performance.

## Understanding the REPL

REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) in Node.js is an interactive environment for quickly testing JavaScript code snippets.

## Package Management with PNPM

PNPM is an alternative package manager that focuses on performance and efficient disk space usage.

### Basic PNPM Commands

- **Install a Package**: `pnpm add [package-name]`
- **Uninstall a Package**: `pnpm remove [package-name]`
- **Update Packages**: `pnpm update`

## Semantic Versioning Explained

Package versions adhere to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format, indicating the impact of changes.

- **Major**: Incompatible API changes.
- **Minor**: Add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- **Patch**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Understanding the package.json File

This file in a Node.js project contains project information and lists its dependencies.

- **Exact Versions**: `"4.0.0"`
- **Accept Minor Updates**: `"^4.0.0"`
- **Accept Patch Updates**: `"~4.0.0"`

## Differences Between npm and npx

- **npm**: Default package manager for Node.js, used for managing dependencies.
- **npx**: A tool for executing Node.js packages, often used for running packages installed locally.
